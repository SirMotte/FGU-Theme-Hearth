[COLOR=#FF8C00][SIZE=4][B]Update to v2.9.22.1 - Torchbearer[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]

[COLOR="#FF0000"][B]Announcement:[/B][/COLOR]

Like the Themes title suggests,
I will pass on the torch for Hearth to others. Namely Justin Freitas and the Unofficial Developers Guild.
Unfortunately I'm no longer able to maintain the theme in a reliable fashion (have been for some time now as you know).

Thus I have decided to step down as a maintainer. I'm not gone mind you, I just want to lift the increasingly heavy feeling of guilt that has been weighting on me for some time now.
I may or may not contribute to Hearth Theme in the future if I feel like it.

Please give a cheerful "HipHip Hooray" to Justin Freitas. I strongly believe he is the perfect fit to further improve Hearth.

That being said, here comes the changelog, all thanks to Justin and seanmccarty. This is where you cheer again please :D.

Taking a long rest.
Sir Motte

[*] Make hover icons use the primary light cream color instead of yellow to ,atch the rest of the UI.
[*] Temporary graphic fixes, including the Height font color (wasn't able to adjust font color so changed background instead).
[*] Remove button definitions for RequestedRolls (seanmccarty)
[*] Added button definition that controls tintable icon colors. Used by RequestedRolls to set icon colors in a theme independent manner. (seanmccarty)
[*] Move extraneous windowclasses from CoreRPG to their correct locations in 4e and PFRPG2.
[*] Chat frame optimizations and also token name label fix like height.
[*] For GM text, use the creamy primary font color instead of bright yellow. Has a much better match and isn't used for any other chat messages (player chat, whisper, etc).
[*] Added lots of fixes and additional buttons to 5e, 4e, Core and OSE2
[*] Added PFRPG2-Legacy support which was causing some of the theme elements to not be recognized.
